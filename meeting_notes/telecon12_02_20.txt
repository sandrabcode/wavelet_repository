summary of telecon on 12/02/20

present: Carmen and Sandra

two potential projects:

Priority #1: 
build up a set of wavelet routines to be used for:

* scale and position dependent emission statistics
* wavelet power spectrum plots
* data deconvolution statistics
* data combination diagnostics

Priority #2:

* multi-scale deconvolution and the possible role of wavelet functions


Plan:

* research literature and insert into literature directory
* prepare test datasets 
  - start with M31 data for which a wavelet analysis has already been done in Dumas et al. 
  - extend this analysis to M100 data
  - test on more ALMA data sets
  
  
  Action items:
  * create a repository for the information (this github) and the images (TODO)
  * look for old wavelet code
